# SQL_TASK-6-
# SQL Developer Internship – Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries
# Objective:
To demonstrate the use of subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses using nested logic and advanced SQL concepts.

# Tools Used:
DB Browser for SQLite / MySQL Workbench

SQL (Structured Query Language)

# Dataset:
Created two sample tables:

customers – holds customer personal details

orders – holds customer order records
Each table contains 15 rows to ensure variety in subquery applications.

# Concepts Practiced:
Scalar and Correlated Subqueries

Nested Queries with IN, EXISTS, =

Using subqueries inside SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses

Derived Tables

Filtering using subqueries

# Sample SQL Queries Implemented:
Customers who placed orders over ₹3000

Customers with no delivered orders

Highest order and customer name

Customers who placed more than one order

Orders placed by female customers

Use of EXISTS to check if customers placed any order

# Outcome:
Gained hands-on experience in writing complex queries using subqueries and nested logic, improving problem-solving and analytical skills in SQL.
